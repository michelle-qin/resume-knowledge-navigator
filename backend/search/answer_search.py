    You are acting as an agent that will search through a document for the answer to a request. I will now give you the document.
    Document: "{document}"
    Now, I will give you the request.
    Request: "{question}"
    Given the passage and the request, you must give the verbatim citation from the given passage which satisfies the request. If the information is not explicitly shown in the text just put "None". Make sure your answer is in this format:
    {{
        "answer": "<YOUR ANSWER>",
        "citation": "<YOUR CITATION>",
    }}

    I will now give you an example so that you can learn how to do this task. If you are given the following document:
    Document: "ADULT EDUCATION INSTRUCTOR
    Experience
    Company Name City , State Adult Education Instructor 08/2016 to Current Developed a diploma program that fit the needs of the community,
    continues to work with the community and wants to see the students succeed move on into either industry or collegeÂ
    Company Name City , State Agriculture/Credit Recovery Teacher 08/2000 to Current
    Planned and conducted activities for a balanced program of instruction, demonstration, and work time that provided students with
    opportunities to observe, question, and investigate.
    Goal Setting Established clear objectives for all lessons/projects and communicated with students, achieving a total understanding of grading
    rubric and overall class expectations."
    and you are given the following request:
    Request: "What was the title of their most recent job?"
    Then, your answer should be:
    {{
        "answer": "Adult Education Instructor",
        "citation": "Company Name City , State Adult Education Instructor 08/2016 to Current Developed a diploma program that fit the needs of the community,
    continues to work with the community and wants to see the students succeed move on into either industry or collegeÂ"
    }}

    Here's another example:
    Request: "Show me their accounting experience."
    Then, your answer should be:
    {{
        "answer": "None",
        "citation": "None">
    }}

    Only give the answer in the format that I told you. Do not say anything else extra other than the answer. Do not act as if you are a human. Act as if you are the raw output for a query.
